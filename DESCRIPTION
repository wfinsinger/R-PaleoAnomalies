Description: The program proceeds to several steps.
    First, the time series are virtually resampled to equal sampling intervals ("prebinning").
    Second, the resampled time series are detrended using a smoothing function.
    Third, a 2-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
    is fitted to the detrended data.
    One of the components is centred around 0,
    and we set the nth quantile of the gaussian distribution of that component
    to determine the threshold separating the noise from the signal.
    Eventually, figures are produced to visualize
      the resampled data,
      the smoothed data,
      the detrended data,
      the GMMs,
      the thresholds and
      the detected anomalies (values beyond the noise threshold).
