-- tapas 0.1.2 10/05/2022 -----------------------------------------------------

* Added the plot_raw() function to produce a polygon plot and optionally
   overlay that with a bar plot of the raw input data (01/12/2022).

* Added two functions (tapas2mgcv and mgcv2tapas) that allow determine the
  'background trend' with a GAM-fitted model. This allows to by-pass the
  SeriesDetrend() function.


-- tapas 0.1.1 20/04/2022 -----------------------------------------------------

* Slightly modified the local_thresh() function. Now it also accommodates
  discontinuous and/or non-binned data sets. Though, this is currently at
  a work-in-progress stage, as the SeriesDetrend() function still requires
  continuous and binned temporal series (i.e. an output from the
  pretreatment_data() function).

* Got rid of trailing horizontal whitespaces

* Fixed issue in pretreatment_data() arising when only one variable is included.

* Fixed issue with the SNI as it did not call the correct data.

* Added a new function export_tapas() that gathers in one data.frame the output
  of the peak_detection(), local_thresh(), or global_thresh() functions. Many
  thanks to Kristen Beck for suggesting this.

* The selection of values to be evaluated with the local GMMs is now simply
  based on the "smoothing.yr" parameter. Previously, the selection was based on
  their index, which was more tedious.

* Fixed issue with "Plot.Anomalies()", as y-axis labels were not printed
  correctly.


-- tapas 0.1.0 22/02/2022 -----------------------------------------------------

* Initial release of the package
