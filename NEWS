-- tapas 0.1.1 20/04/2022 -----------------------------------------------------

* Got rid of trailing horizontal whitespaces

* Fixed issue in pretreatment_data() arising when only one variable is included.

* Fixed issue with the SNI as it did not call the correct data.

* Added a new function "export_tapas()"", gathers in one data.frame the output
  of the peak_detection(), local_thresh(), or global_thresh() functions. Many
  thanks to Kristen Beck for suggesting this.

* The selection of values to be evaluated with the local GMMs is now simply
  based on the "smoothing.yr" parameter. Previously, the selection was based on
  their index, which was more tedious.

* Fixed issue with "Plot.Anomalies()", as y-axis labels were not printed
  correctly.


-- tapas 0.1.0 22/02/2022 -----------------------------------------------------

* Initial release of the package
