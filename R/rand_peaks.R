#' A random series with charcoal peaks that are proportional to background
#' CHAR, i.e. peaks get bigger as background gets bigger, half way through the
#' record. The frequency of peaks does not change throughout this record. Thus,
#' peak-detection methods should identify no difference in peak frequency
#' between 1st and 2nd half of this record.
#'
#' This record is similar to that displayed in Figure 2 ("Scenario 2") in
#' Higuera et al (2010) Peak detection in sediment-charcoal records:
#' impacts of alternative data analysis methods on fire-history interpretations.
