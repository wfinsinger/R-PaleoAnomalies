#' A random series with no peaks, only red noise
#'
#' A random series with no distinct charcoal peaks, only red noise
#' (random variation with 1st-order autocorrelation of ca 0.3).
#' Any real record should have a median signal-to-noise index greater than that
#' from the series of red noise.
#'
#' This record is similar to that displayed in Figure 2 ("RN") in
#' Kelly et al. (2011) A signal-to-noise index to quantify the potential for
#' peak detection in sediment-charcoal records. Quaternary Research 75:11-17.
#'
#' The original record was limited to samples having \code{age_bot < 10,000}
#' years to reduce its size.
