# R-package: tapas

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


## Rationale

The set of functions gathered under the hood of ***tapas*** is meant to be used for analyzing paleoecological records, when the goal is to estimate the long-term Trend and detect Peaks to reconstruct the occurrence, the return intervals, and the magnitude of distinct events.

*tapas* builds on *CharAnalysis* (https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis), a software for analyzing sediment-charcoal records written in and compiled with Matlab 7.0 by Phil Higuera (Higuera et al., 2009), with significant input by (amongst others) Patrick Bartlein (U of OR), Daniel Gavin (U of OR), Jennifer Marlon, and Ryan Kelly.

Two main reasons led to the development of *tapas*. Firstly, as R is an open source product, modifying the program to suit individual needs may be more straigthforward. Secondly, an integration and inter-operability with other existing R-packages may allow using peak-detection analysis in conjunction with other workflows and types of paleoecological records (see for instance [(Cagliero et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00334-021-00862-x)).

## Usage

A typical workflow of the peak-detection analysis includes the following steps [(Higuera et al., 2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF09134):
1. *resample* the record to equally spaced sampling intervals in time (years), a procedure also called "binning";
2. *decompose* the resampled record into a long-term trend (background component) and peaks (peak component);
3. *screen* the peak component to distinguish signal from noise using
  * 3.1 a unique *global* 2-component Gaussian mixture model, or
  * 3.2 *local* 2-component Gaussian mixture models,
  * 3.3 and eventually also screen the peak component using a minimum-count test;
4. *evaluate* the suitability of the record for peak-detection analysis using the signal-to-noise index [(Kelly et al., 2011)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2010.07.011).

*tapas* performs steps 1.) and 2.) for several variables of one dataset type (e.g. different estimates of charcoal abundance). Instead, steps 3.) and 4.) are performed for one user-selected variable.

To run your own data, make a new folder within an umbrella folder, and save it under a name, e.g., `Data-In`. Then place a file (e.g., `MyData.csv`) in that folder. The input data file will contain the sample depths, sample ages, sample volume, and the variable(s). The file should have the following formatting: It has headers and at least six fields. The first five columns will report the metadata for the samples, the subsequent columns contain the variable(s) to be analysed (e.g., the abundance of charcoal pieces).

CmTop | CmBot | AgeTop | AgeBot | Volume | variable1 | variable2 | ... | nth-variable
------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|-------------
 0.5  |  1    | -42    | -24    | 3      | 8         | 0.01      | ... |    ...      
 1    |  1.5  | -24    | 5      | 3      | 18        | 0.005     | ... |    ...      
 

The depths and ages should be arranged in ascending order. Sample ages should thus be reported as *calendar ages BP*.


Load the data into the R environment

> MyData <- read.csv("./Data-In/MyData.csv")

***

## Installation

Install the development version of PaleoAnomalies with:

``` r
# library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("wfinsinger/tapas")
```

The `check_pretreat()` function can be used to verify the input data is formatted correctly. If the samples in the input file are not contiguous, the `check_pretreat()` function will add rows for the missing samples. Should the dataset contain samples that were deposited in a very short amount of time (e.g., slumps, tephras), for which AgeTop = AgeBot, these samples will be flagged and removed, and a new depth scale will be created to replace the original one.

> MyData <- check_pretreat(Mydata)

The functions can either be run individually and stepwise, or the wrapper function `peak_detection()` can be used to perform an analysis including steps from 1.) to 4.) in one go.

For instance, to analyse the MyData dataset for variable1:

> MyData_peaks <- peak_detection(series = MyData, proxy = "variable1")

Individual output plots can be generated with dedicated plotting functions:

> Plot.Anomalies(MyData_peaks, plot.neg = F)

> Plot_ReturnIntervals(MyData_peaks)

Alternatively, the analysis can be done step-by-step (see below for further details).

## Example

The package comes with toy data (`co_char_data`) to play with. This is a macroscopic charcoal record from ([Code Lake](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Higuera_et_al_2009_lake_sediment_pollen_and_charcoal_data/984310/4), Higuera et al., 2009).

```{r toy_data}
library(tapas)
co <- co_char_data
```

The dataset can be analysed, for instance, with the following settings (leaving other arguments with their default values). These are the same settings used by [Higuera et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1890/07-2019.1).

```{r peak-detection Code Lake, fig.keep='none', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
co_loc <- peak_detection(series = co, proxy = "char",
                                first = -51, last = 7500, yrInterp = 15,
                                detr_type = "mov.median", sens = F)
```

With these settings, the results obtained using *tapas* strikingly resemble those obtained by [Higuera et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1890/07-2019.1) with *CharAnalysis*:

![Code Lake: peak-detection outputs](/README_Figures/01_Code_Lake_peak_detection.jpg "Code Lake: peak-detection outputs")

![Code Lake: reconstructed fire-return intervals (FRI)](/README_Figures/02_Code_Lake_FRIs.jpg "Code Lake: reconstructed fire-return intervals (FRI)")



Alternatively, the data can be analysed step-by-step:

The first step is to resample the time series with `pretreatment_data()`:

``` {r resample}
co_i <- pretreatment_data(
  series = co, out = "accI", series.name = "co",
  first = -50, last = 7450, yrInterp = 15
)
```

Then, detrend the data with `series_detrend()`:

``` {r detrend, fig.show='animate', ffmpeg.format='gif', dev='jpeg'}
co_detr <- SeriesDetrend(
  series = co_i, smoothing.yr = 500,
  detr.type = "rob.loess"
)
```

Fit gaussian mixture models to determine the noise-signal threshold

- With a Global Threshold (default options):
``` {r global_threshold_default, fig.show='animate', ffmpeg.format='gif', dev='jpeg'}
char_thresh_gl <- global_thresh(series = co_detr, proxy = "charAR")
```

- With minimum-count test and removing consecutive peak samples.
``` {r global_threshold_config, fig.show='animate', ffmpeg.format='gif', dev='jpeg'}
char_thresh_gl <- global_thresh(
  series = co_detr,
  proxy = "charAR",
  thresh.value = 0.95,
  smoothing.yr = NULL,
  keep_consecutive = FALSE,
  minCountP = 0.95,
  MinCountP_window = 150
)
```

Once the analysis is done, plot the anomalies:
``` {r plot_anomalies}
Plot.Anomalies(
  series = char_thresh_gl,
  plot.crosses = TRUE,
  plot.x = FALSE,
  plot.neg = FALSE
)
```

And plot the intervals:
``` {r plot_intervals}
Plot_ReturnIntervals(
  series = char_thresh_gl,
  plot.x = TRUE,
  plot.neg = FALSE
)
```

## Details

* 1.) *resampling* the record to equally spaced sampling intervals in time (years) is performed using the `pretreatment_data()` function, which loops the `paleofire::pretreatment()` function for all variables in the input data frame. The user can choose among the following output data types:
+ resampled accumulation rates (out = "accI"; default),
+ resampled concentrations (out = "conI"), or
+ resampled input data (e.g., if variable1 in the input is charcoal counts, with out = "countI" one gets resampled counts).
* 2.) *decomposition* of the resampled record into a long-term trend (background component) and peaks (peak component) is performed with the `SeriesDetrend()` function for all variables in the input data frame. The user can select the smoothing-window width (in years) as well as the type of the detrending. Currently, the following functions are implemented to smooth the timeseries: + robust loess ("rob.loess"),
+ robust Lowess ("rob.lowess"), and
+ moving median ("mov.median"; aka Method #4 in CharAnalysis' Matlab version);
* 3.1) *screen* the peak component to distinguish signal from noise using one or more 2-component Gaussian mixture models that are determined using the `mclust` R package [Scrucca et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2016-021).
+ unique *global* 2-component Gaussian mixture model (`Global_Thresh()`), or
+ several *local* 2-component Gaussian mixture models (`Local_Thresh()`);
* 3.2) and eventually also *screen* the peak component using a minimum-count test. This part of the `Global_Thresh()` and `Local_Thresh()` functions was translated verbatim from *CharAnalysis*.
* 4.) *evaluate* the suitability of the record for peak-detection analysis using the signal-to-noise index [SNI; R code from Supplementary Material to Kelly et al., 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2010.07.011).
* 5.) Diagnostic plots showing the sensitivity to different smoothing-window widths are produced with the `peak-detection()` function if the function's argument `sens=TRUE`.

## Acknowledgements & Credits
The development of this set of functions would not have been possible without the Matlab-coded templates that were written and made open source by Philip Higuera (https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis). I'm thankful to Dan Gavin for suggesting tweaks to accomodate for non-standard data-input formats. His suggestions led to the `check_pretreatment()` function. I'm extremely thankful to Petr Kunes and several CharAnalysis users who ignited the conversation over the past few years about getting that program into R.

If you use *tapas* in your publications, please cite *https://github.com/wfinsinger/tapas* and any non-default settings applied. The packaging of these functions is in progress.
